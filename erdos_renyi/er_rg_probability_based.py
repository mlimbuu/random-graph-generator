'''
1) Nodes Initialization: The graph starts with n nodes and no edges.
2) Edge Consideration: For each pair of nodes (let's say nodes i and j), the algorithm considers whether to add an edge between them.
3) Random Decision: For each pair, a random number is generated (typically uniformly distributed between 0 and 1). If this number is less than or equal to 
p, an edge between i and j is added to the graph. If the number is greater than 
p, no edge is added between those nodes.

Note: For n=10 nodes, there are nC2 = 45 possible edges that can be added. 
When you use p=0.3, each of these 45 possible edges has a 30% chance of being included in the graph.
